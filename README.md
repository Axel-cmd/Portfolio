# Portfolio

## 👋 Overview

This repository contains the source code of my **personal developer portfolio**.

The goal of this project is to present my **projects**, **technical skills**, and **professional background** through a clean and responsive website.  

Although the website content itself is written in French, the codebase and documentation are fully open-source and intended to be understandable and reusable.
